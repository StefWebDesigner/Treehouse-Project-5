---Search Filter
Hi everyone! Hope yall are having a great weekend. I was wondering if someone could help me with SearchFilter. I have been stuck on this for days now and can't seem to figure it out. I believe I got the plugin working; however, I can't link the input from the HTML to the js/app.js. I'll include the snippet here. 
If you could help, I would greatly appreciate it.

--- HTML
		<body>
		<!-- <body class="grid"> -->

			<script>
				function getInput() {
					window.location='js/app.js';
				}
			</script>
			<button onkeypress="getInput();"> <input type="search" placeholder="Search" name="search"> </button>
	
		<aside class="grid">
			<div class="grid gallery">
					<div class="photo">
						<div class="side-a">
							<a href="../photos/01.jpg" data-caption="picture of a farm and straw pastures">
								<img src="../photos/01.jpg" alt="picture of a farm">
							</a>	
						</div> <!-- END > SIDE A -->
						<div class="side-b">
							<!-- It's click responsive on both side but still only shows the picture -->
							<a href="../photos/01.jpg" data-caption="picture of a farm and straw pastures"> 
							<h3>Hay Bales</h3>
							<p> I love hay bales. Took this snap on a drive through the countryside past some straw fields.
							</p>
						</a>
	........ (Toward the end)

    		<!-- Java Scripts -->
		<script src="js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>
		<script src="js/baguetteBox.min.js" async>
			window.addEventListener('load', function() {
  			baguetteBox.run('.gallery');
			});
		</script>
		<script src="js/jquery.searchFilter.js"></script>
		<script src="js/app.js"></script>


------ app.js

//Search Filter

const search = new Filter('search', 'data-caption');

function searchBar(search) {

    //Find a way to link the HMTL buttion to this input like with prompt
let input = document.querySelector('body').innerHTML = search;  //this should take the iput from body
                                                                //look for the data and search terms
let message;

if (input === search) {
search = document.querySelector('aside').innerHTML ; //Show the search in the body

}

}

Buegette Plugin

Also, I had some questions about adding the arrows and animations to the lighthouse plugin. I look up instructions on the elements needed; however, it doesn't seem to work. In the example, it shows a different class.  But, I assume I suppose to add my class or photo container. Then, I'm unsure how to get these effects working?

---- js/app.js

window.addEventListener('load', function() {
   baguetteBox.run('.gallery');
      Animation: 'fadeIn'
      afterHide: 'null'

  });
